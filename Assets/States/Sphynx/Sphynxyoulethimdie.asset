    you, Sphynx."

    ///ADVISE. Commlink severed.///

    //Checking...//


    The
    transport craft glides out of the hull of the damaged Daedilus, and once it left
    the protective shield bubble around the ship, a second Indix cruiser drops out
    of FTL.

    //Firing main artillery battery...//

    //SUCCESS.
    Checking...//

    the transport was, nothing else, no life signs.
