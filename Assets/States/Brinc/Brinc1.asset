  storyText: "Another day in ABSOLUTE BLOODY PARADISE. The Captain just called in
    sick, so you're the only QUALIFIED (in your eyes) officer on this entire level
    of this death trap in space. You read the reports about the Indix in the area,
    so it'd probably be well-advised to activate that robot chick that they dropped
    into the computer as a precaution. \nWhat do you do? Do you just ignore the program?\n\n1.
    No, activate the newfangled machine.\n2. Nothing beats humans, leave the thing."
