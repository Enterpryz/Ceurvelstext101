  storyText: 'The three of you enter the shuttle, Fredricks turns to look at you,

    "We''re
    ready to disembark, sir."

    You nod,

    "Let''s go, then."

    The shuttle
    drops out of the hangar and drifts out of the safety of the Daedilus, the three
    of you only get halfway to the disabled cruiser when a second drops out of FTL.
    The shuttle rocks and Fredricks yells,

    "Oh my God!"

    There''s a flash
    of light, and then.. nothing.
