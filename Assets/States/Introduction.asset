  storyText: 'Welcome to Fleetbreaker: Daedilus Siege. You can call me The Builder,
    I''ll be your guide.

    Before you are three options, three individuals with
    their own failings, strengths, and backstories to discover as you play through
    this adventure.

    I must advise you, think through every decision with care,
    as something insignificant may lead to dire consequences...

    Good luck, and
    I will see you on the Daedilus.
