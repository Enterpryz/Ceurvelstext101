  storyText: 'The alarms blare as you watch the heavy artillery on the top and sides
    of the ship turn toward the Indix cruiser. Screens on the bridge light up green
    and yellow, and the air is filled with the sounds of alarms, mechanical beeping,
    and crewmen running from console to console. You flick your gaze to the large
    windows on the bridge again, and watch as volleys of heavy artillery, laser cannons,
    and missiles fly from your ship straight toward the Indix cruiser. Most of the
    rounds hit true, disabling the ship.

    "Now THAT is what I like to see!" Brinc
    exclaimed from his seat, "I''m going to arrange a boarding party and pay those
    bastards a visit."

    /"That is ill-advised, sir, there is a very high risk
    factor, as my scanners detect reinforcements en route. I cannot let you proceed,
    sir."/
