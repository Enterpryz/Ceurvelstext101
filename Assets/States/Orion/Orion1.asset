  storyText: "Just another day on the big tin can. The war's been going downhill
    for months. That's not the only thing going downhill, though, this flu pandemic
    onboard is going to be the death of me.\n I am Captain Orion, and I have the
    flu. It's been eating me alive, just like the Indix have been chewing through
    our ships like they were just paper boats. \nThey say the Daedilus is different,
    she's faster and smarter, and has one of those newfangled OBLACS like Nova and
    the Fleetmaker. \n///ADVISE. It is currently 0730 hours, shift begins momentarily.\n\nOh,
    hell, should I turn in?\n1. Call Brinc and call in sick.\n2. Take your time,
    but show up eventually.\n3. Ain't no time like the present."
