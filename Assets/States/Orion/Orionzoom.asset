  storyText: 'You don''t even bother calling, as soon as the computer began to say

    time for somebody in their forties. Brinc turns to look at you from his seat,

    "Sir,
    I have reports of high Indix activity in our sector, should I engage Sphynx?"

    "Do
    it, and ready the shields."

    Brinc nods, and as you watch the crystal-like
    sphere form around the ship, it shakes. You look through a window and see one
    of the massive Indix cruisers dropping out of FTL.
